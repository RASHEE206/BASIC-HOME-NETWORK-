# BASIC-HOME-NETWORK-
# üè° Building a Simulated Home Network on Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates how to set up and configure a simple home network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It covers both **wired and wireless connectivity**, DHCP configuration, router setup, and device testing.

---

## üìå Steps Taken 

### 1. Planned the Network Layout
- Designed a basic home setup including:
  - Wireless Router (Linksys WRT300N)
  - PC to simulate a webcam
  - Laptop for wireless testing
  - Smartphone (optional realism)

### 2. Selected Devices
- **Wireless Router** ‚Üí Linksys WRT300N  
- **PC** ‚Üí Used to simulate a webcam (wired)  
- **Laptop** ‚Üí Tested wireless connectivity  
- **Smartphone** ‚Üí Added realism to the network  

### 3. Configured the Wireless Router
- Set **SSID**: `HomeNetwork`  
- Enabled **WPA2-PSK encryption**  
- Configured passphrase: `mypassword` *(for demo purposes)*  
- Configured LAN settings for IP addressing and connectivity  

### 4. Enabled DHCP
- Allowed devices to automatically obtain IP addresses  
- Ensured seamless communication within the network  

### 5. Simulated the Webcam Connection
- Connected a PC via **Copper Straight-Through Cable** (wired)  
- Connected a laptop wirelessly to the router  
- Assigned both devices to the same SSID and confirmed connectivity  

### 6. Tested Network Connectivity
- Used the `ping` command to confirm communication:
  - Device ‚Üî Router  
  - Device ‚Üî Device within the LAN  

### 7. Added Realism
- Included a **smartphone** to reflect a modern home setup with multiple connected devices

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This simulation provided a clear, practical understanding of how to configure and secure a small home network.  
It involved:
- Wired and wireless connectivity  
- DHCP management  
- Real-time device communication  

Such setups form the **foundation of modern smart homes**.

## üîê Security Note
For demonstration, the same password (`mypassword`) was used across all devices.  
‚ö†Ô∏è In real-world scenarios:  
- Always use **strong, unique passwords** for network security  
- Regularly update router firmware and Wi-Fi security settings
